# Object-Oriented JavaScript Independent Project: Ping-Pong
_*Epicodus Introduction to Programming Week 4 Project, 11-05-16*_

by Suzi Rubino

##Description
The instructions for the requirements of this project are as follows:

###Order Pizza
 - [ ] Create a website for a pizza company where a user can choose one or more individual toppings (cheese, pepperoni, artichoke, anchovy, etc) and a size to order a pizza and see the final cost.

 - [ ] Allow the user to choose toppings and size for the pizza they'd like to order.

 - [ ] Create a pizza object constructor with properties for toppings and size.

 - [ ] Create a prototype method for the cost of a pizza depending on the selections chosen. Use your own formula for this.

###Further Exploration

 - [ ] Style your site with CSS and images.
 - [ ] Allow users to order more than one pizza with different toppings.
 - [ ] Display the list of pizzas ordered as links that can be clicked for details.
 - [ ] Offer a delivery option that then requires address information.

###Objectives
 - [ ] Code meets standards from previous weeks.
 - [ ] Objects drive business logic (in JavaScript, not jQuery).
 - [ ] Constructors and prototypes are used successfully.
 - [ ] Application works as expected.
 - [ ] Plain English specs are included in your README.
 - [ ] Required functionality is in place by the 5:00pm Friday deadline.
 - [ ] Project is in a polished, portfolio-quality state.
 - [ ] Project demonstrates an understanding of this week's concepts. If prompted, you can discuss your code with an instructor using correct terminology.
